- puts @compony.inspect (like console log but renders everything, not practical)
- life cycle callback (append_schema) -

### SIZE OF THE db
- .length (checks the leangth of the array)
- .size (checks ActiveRecord size (db and length))
- .count (checks the db itself)

### MAP render
- JQuery
- Select2
- yarn install
- bootstrap
- yarn add select2-bootstrap
- install NVM (version control to change because of dependancies)
