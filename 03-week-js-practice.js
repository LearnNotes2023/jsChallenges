// Each team will give a brief (three minute) presentation of their application. Presenting your project will allow you to practice communication and coding vocabulary. Presentations are not a judgement of your work or ability as each team will have different weaknesses and strengths. Presentations allow other members of the cohort to appreciate a different approach to solving a complex problem.

// Full team: show off your application's user interface (UI)
// First team member: What was your team's approach to solving this problem? Did the initial approach work out in the end?
// Second team member: What was the hardest thing about this project? What is your biggest takeaway?
// Third team member (if applicable): How did you manage the workflow in a group of three?

// üé≤ Challenge: Dice Roller
// As a developer, you are tasked with creating a dice application. The application will allow the user to role a standard six-sided dice and see the result of each roll. As the user rolls the dice, each roll gets logged which creates a list of all the previous rolls.

// When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. The dice UI will be in its own component as will the roll log UI. App.js controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the dice and roll component.
