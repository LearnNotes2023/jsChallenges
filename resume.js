// Your career summary is not as strong as it should be. 
// This is a key piece to compel the hiring manager to keep reading. 
// Flesh out your career summary to define you as a professional and cover those areas most relevant to the job that you seek.

// Based on how the resume is phrased, you could be perceived as a "doer," as opposed to an "achiever." 
// A few too many of your job descriptions are task-based and not results-based. 
// This means that they tell you what you did, instead of what you achieved. 
// This is a common misstep for non-professional resume writers. 
// To be effective and create excitement a good resume aids the hiring executive envisage you delivering similar achievements at his or her company.

// Phrases like “Managed” and “developed” are monotonous, overused, and add little value to your resume. 
// Strong action verbs, used with engaging language to outline outstanding achievements, are essential parts of a soundly-built resume.

// Now, let's see how to put this into practice. Here's a real life sample taken from a former client's resume. By changing the language, we helped to enhance the perception of the job-seeker.

// Passive language / Doing: “Negotiated contracts with vendors”
// Action language / Achieving: “Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs 30% by negotiating pricing and fees, while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services.”
// An adjustment like this makes a big improvement.

// I'd like to see your document more polished, something more fitting of your experience level. Remember that your resume is your marketing tool. It's the first glimpse a potential employer has of you.

// Using bullets to highlight important information is helpful, but in your specific case, you should consider using a few less. 
// It can be hard to narrow in on the most pertinent information when there are too many bullets. Size and type of bullets are also a consideration. 
// Although seemingly minor, visual impact of a resume is the key to ensuring that an employer reads it thoroughly.

// An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a program used by employers to screen applicants based on the contents of their resume before passing viable candidates
//  on to the hiring manager. to filter candidates from the application pool. To illustrate how you stand up to the automation, 
// I passed your resume through the very same software that Hiring Managers use to filter the real talent from the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of candidates that apply for a single open position.

// What is something you are quite proud of?
// I am very proud of my 11-year experience in one company. I loved how I grew with the company and implemented my ideas to facilitate rapid growth, automating, and correcting workflows. The most significant achievement was educating myself in oil refining and creating a form for calculating losses, which greatly benefited the company. I apply the same structure to my life, believing that things don't disappear; they just have not been accounted for correctly.

// If you could discuss any topic with anyone in the world for 1 hour, who would you pick and what would be the topic?
// My favorite topic is organizing, and I would love to talk to David Allen about the GTD system and why it doesn't work. I do have a separate division in my planner called 'Organize My Organizer' because my planning system always needs improvement. However, jokes aside, on a very serious note, I would talk to Stan Lee and find out why, of all the superheroes, they decided to kill off Iron Man. This was an unnecessary loss that could have been avoided.


// What's a generally contrarian opinion you hold?
// "That's a tough one. I definitely think working on Windows is better than Mac. The reason I hold such an opposing view is that Windows has been with me for a quarter of a century, and it is definitely easier getting around it. Also, regardless of what people say, HTML is a language. I am very positive and stand firm on this belief.

// Please provide examples of stores you've worked on and the specific features and design elements you built.
// I have experience in the oil industry, and working with both B2B and B2C entails two distinct fields of work. While focusing specifically on B2B outreach in my role, we underwent a logo transformation to align with our company's location in Siberia, Russia. This involved incorporating flames resembling a gas pipe. The motivation behind redesigning our department's logo was to distinguish ourselves from other B2B businesses. Given that many oil companies are situated in the north, this strategic logo change aimed to attract the attention of potential customers.
